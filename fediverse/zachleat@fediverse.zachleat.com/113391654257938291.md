Thankful to see that 11ty was removed from the next State of JS survey (per my request): [https://github.com/Devographics/surveys/issues/252#issuecomment-2443276622](https://github.com/Devographics/surveys/issues/252#issuecomment-2443276622)

I maintain that the State of JS is mostly a popularity contest, highly correlated to marketing budgets and VC investment.
