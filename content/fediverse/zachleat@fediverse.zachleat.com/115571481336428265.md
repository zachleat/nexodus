\<p>I can track web development eras like tree rings, but each ring is move-fast-and-break-things devs saying “we don’t care about Y and you shouldn’t either—here are a bunch of tools that disregard Y” and indie folks saying “no thanks, I do care about Y—those tools aren’t useful if they don’t take Y into account.”\</p>\<p>Later it becomes “as an industry we have always thought Y was very important—we should build \*new\* tools that embrace Y, I wish someone would have said something before”\</p>\<p>Rinse &amp; repeat.\</p>
