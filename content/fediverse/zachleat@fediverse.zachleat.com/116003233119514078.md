\<p>What’s a good name for the UX pattern where a search field in a header shows results inline, but the search itself does not occupy its own page or independent history entries? \</p>\<p>Practically, it means you can’t go back to it. You can to navigate to ONE SEARCH RESULT and only one (especially if you open in a new tab, though support for that is pretty iffy in this pattern!). All context about the search is lost when you select something.\</p>
