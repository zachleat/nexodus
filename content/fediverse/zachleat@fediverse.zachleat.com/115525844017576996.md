\<p>The absolute UX \*drama\* of the new tinted (vs. clear) Liquid Glass preference in the macOS 26.1 System Settings. Why separate from the Reduce Transparency accessibility toggle? Why so prominent in the Appearance section? Why do users need to know about Liquid Glass at all? Mistakes were made here 😅\</p>
