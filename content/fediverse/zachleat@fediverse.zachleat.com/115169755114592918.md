\<p>Crashing out at how poorly npm (Microsoft) is handling this security incident. Eleventy is not affected any more but \*lots\* of other tools in the JavaScript ecosystem are!\</p>\<p>Hours later and the compromised package versions are still public…\</p>\<p>Maybe don’t install anything from npm today, folks.\</p>\<p>Edit: the issue was resolved at approximately 18:30Z\</p>
