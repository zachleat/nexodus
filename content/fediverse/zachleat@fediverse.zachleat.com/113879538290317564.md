I’ve been to far too many family funerals in the past couple of years.

When my time is up (far, far from now) I hope that whoever speaks offers the listeners a message of acceptance and peace — not one of fire and brimstone, not one of conditional love through unconditional allegiance.

Take care of each other, y’all ❤️
