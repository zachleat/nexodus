Shiraishi: In this session, we'll be looking at Nintendo eShop.

Tsuda: Yes, Nintendo eShop is the Nintendo Switch shop. It also provides a service that allows you to purchase game software from your smartphone even when you don't have a Switch. Both are created on the web.

Shiraishi: That kind of multi-platform development is what the Web excels at.

Horikawa: That's right. The parts that can be seen on smartphones and PCs are made responsive, and a large part of the code can be shared. However, when operating on a game console, the controls are operated with buttons, so the code is slightly different.

The eShop is fairly large-scale for a web app, but the architecture is unified across the board, using React as the foundation of the architecture .
