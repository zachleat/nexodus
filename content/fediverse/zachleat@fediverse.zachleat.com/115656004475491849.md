\<p>Free idea:\</p>\<p>A developer conference (née job fair) where all of the speakers are folks that aren’t employed and are looking! Speakers would really benefit from the authority that conference speaking provides and employers looking to hire can send their own devs in to learn (and recruit)!\</p>
