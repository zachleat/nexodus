Really enjoying working with vitest.dev on a project that needs to be tested in Node, Safari, Firefox, and Chrome!

My favorite bits:

1. Easy to setup headless browsers with Browser Mode
2. CLI runs in watch mode by default (and not on CI)
3. Has all the `assert` APIs I was used to
4. test.skipIf üèÜ
